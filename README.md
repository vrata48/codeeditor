# Code Editor MCP Server

⚠️ **WORK IN PROGRESS** ⚠️  
This project has just begun development and may not work as expected. Features are being actively developed and tested.

## Purpose

This is a **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** designed to enable AI assistants to write, edit, and manage code files directly. The server provides a comprehensive set of tools for code generation, file manipulation, and project management.

## Usage

### Claude Configuration
Add this to your Claude desktop app configuration:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "codeeditor": {
            "command": "c:\\MCPs\\CodeEditor\\CodeEditor.MCP.exe",
            "args": [
                "--directory=c:\\Projects\\OLAP2"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

### File Access Control
- **Directory targeting**: The server operates on the directory specified in the `--directory` argument
- **GitIgnore filtering**: All file operations respect `.gitignore` patterns
- **Safe operations**: Only files not listed in `.gitignore` are accessible for reading/writing
- **Project integrity**: Build artifacts, dependencies, and other ignored files remain untouched

This ensures the MCP server integrates cleanly with your existing project workflow without interfering with version control or build processes.

## AI-Generated Code

**Every line of code in this project was generated by AI.**

The author's role is limited to:
- Writing instructions and requirements
- Debugging and testing the generated code
- Providing feedback for improvements
- Defining the MCP server specifications

## Current AI Assistant

This project is currently being developed with **Claude Sonnet 4** by Anthropic.

## Language Support

### Primary Focus: C#
The server includes specialized tools for C# development:
- Class and interface creation/modification
- Method and property management
- Project building and testing
- NuGet package restoration
- Solution management

### Universal File Operations
While optimized for C#, the underlying file operations support **any programming language**:
- Read/write files in any format
- Search and replace across codebases
- File and directory management
- Copy/move/delete operations

## MCP Server Capabilities

This server enables AI assistants to:
- Generate complete code projects from scratch
- Modify existing codebases intelligently
- Manage project structure and dependencies
- Run builds and tests
- Perform code analysis and refactoring

## Integration

This MCP server can be integrated with any AI assistant that supports the MCP, enabling seamless code generation and editing capabilities.
