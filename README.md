# Code Editor MCP Server

⚠️ **WORK IN PROGRESS** ⚠️  
This project has just begun development and may not work as expected. Features are being actively developed and tested.

## Purpose

This is a **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** designed to enable AI assistants to write, edit, and manage code files directly. The server provides a comprehensive set of tools for code generation, file manipulation, and project management.

## First Generation Architecture

**This is the first generation of the Code Editor MCP Server.** Like the evolution of 3D printing technology, where early printers were used to create parts for better, more sophisticated printers, this first generation serves as the foundation for creating its own successor.

Once this generation reaches a complete(ish) state, it will be used to architect and generate a second generation that will be:
- Better written and optimized
- More efficient in tool implementation
- Enhanced with lessons learned from real-world usage
- Refined through the iterative development process

This evolutionary approach leverages the tools themselves to improve the tools, creating a self-improving development cycle as the MCP ecosystem and AI capabilities continue to evolve.

## Usage

### Claude Configuration
Add this to your Claude desktop app configuration:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "codeeditor": {
            "command": "c:\\MCPs\\CodeEditor\\CodeEditor.MCP.exe",
            "args": [
                "--directory=c:\\Projects\\OLAP2"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

### File Access Control
- **Directory targeting**: The server operates on the directory specified in the `--directory` argument
- **GitIgnore filtering**: All file operations respect `.gitignore` patterns
- **Safe operations**: Only files not listed in `.gitignore` are accessible for reading/writing
- **Project integrity**: Build artifacts, dependencies, and other ignored files remain untouched

This ensures the MCP server integrates cleanly with your existing project workflow without interfering with version control or build processes.

## AI-Generated Code

**Every line of code in this project was generated by AI.**

The author's role is limited to:
- Writing instructions and requirements
- Debugging and testing the generated code
- Providing feedback for improvements
- Defining the MCP server specifications

## Current AI Assistant

This project is currently being developed with **Claude Sonnet 4** by Anthropic.

## Language Support

### Primary Focus: C#
The server includes specialized tools for C# development:
- Class and interface creation/modification
- Method and property management
- Project building and testing
- NuGet package restoration
- Solution management

### Universal File Operations
While optimized for C#, the underlying file operations support **any programming language**:
- Read/write files in any format
- Search and replace across codebases
- File and directory management
- Copy/move/delete operations

## MCP Server Capabilities

This server enables AI assistants to:
- Generate complete code projects from scratch
- Modify existing codebases intelligently
- Manage project structure and dependencies
- Run builds and tests
- Perform code analysis and refactoring

## Integration

This MCP server can be integrated with any AI assistant that supports the MCP, enabling seamless code generation and editing capabilities.
